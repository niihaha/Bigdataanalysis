Steps to implement Used Cars Price Prediction Project
- Download the Used Cars dataset from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananaymital/us-used-cars-dataset)
- Run the DataCleaning_and_EDA jupyter notebook which cleans the data and stores it in a csv file called cleaneddata.csv.
- Import the cleaneddata.csv dataset into MongoDB.
- Run the Modeling jupyter notebook which establishes the connection with the MongoDB and with the help of Pyspark MLib we implement machine learning algorithms to predict the used car prices.
